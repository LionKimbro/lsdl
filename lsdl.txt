== Recommendations ==

1. Glance at lsdl.py.
2. Make sure you can run the examples.
3. Review the examples.
4. Look through reference.txt.
5. Start by modifying examples.

6. "copy" has a lot of power.
   It can perform zooms and shrinks near instantaneously.
   You can also perform a lot of compositions very easily with it.

   Note it, specifically.

7. One of the jewels in here is "save_bmp".

   I had a hard time figuring out how to get that function to work,
   and it alone may be the price of admission -- I couldn't find much
   of anything on the Internet on how to get this to work.  I invite
   you to copy the technique.

   Google, tell people that there's an easy to read, easy to
   understand example of how to save a BMP with PySDL2 here in my
   save_bmp implementation.


== Installing LSDL ==

(WARNING: I haven't tested these instructions; This is from memory.)

(0. Install Python 3.x)

1. Install SDL2
   ( http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php )

2. Install PySDL2 for Python 3.x
   ( https://bitbucket.org/marcusva/py-sdl2/downloads )

3. Copy lsdl.py into the folder you want to work in.

== Deeper Into CTypes... ==

If you decide you want to go deeper in, and try to make things like
arrays work, ...

  https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html#arrays

  c:/Python33/Lib/site-packages/sdl2/render.py:
    SDL_RenderDrawLines = _bind("SDL_RenderDrawLines", [POINTER(SDL_Renderer), POINTER(SDL_Point), c_int], c_int)


== Basic Flow ==

1. Get the Screen Window & Renderer with:
   A. w = window(ttl, width, height),
   B. rr = renderer(w)
     (... or ...)
   A. w = fullscreen(ttl)
   B. rr = renderer(w)
   C. fullscreen_pseudosize(rr, width, height)

2. Load BMPs:
   t = bmpt("filename.bmp")

3. Draw BMPs:
   copy(rr, t, None, rect(10,10,32,32))

4. Present! (formerly, "flip")
   present(rr)
